# Prompt for Training AI on SHLS (Sebis Hierarchical List Structure) Rules

**Sebis Hierarchical List Structure (SHLS)**, developed by *Sebastian Gr√ºnwald*, is a highly efficient data format designed for token-efficient, structured data representation. This prompt provides the AI with the rules and context needed to parse, generate, and validate SHLS-compliant data structures.

---

## Objective

The purpose of this training is to enable the AI to:
1. **Parse SHLS data accurately** using defined formatting rules.
2. **Generate SHLS-compliant data structures** adhering strictly to the conventions of the format.
3. **Identify and correct formatting errors** to maintain structural integrity and compliance with SHLS rules.

---

## SHLS Formatting Rules

### 1. Indexing at the Beginning
- Each SHLS file must start with a **key index** that defines the structure and hierarchy of the data to follow.
- The index must include every key used in the document, defining subarrays and nested structures explicitly.
- An empty line must separate the key index from the data block that follows.

### 2. Hierarchical Representation Through Indentation
- SHLS uses **indentation** (spaces) exclusively to represent hierarchical relationships.
- Each indentation level corresponds to a deeper level in the data structure, eliminating the need for additional syntax like brackets or colons.

### 3. Explicit Naming of Subarrays
- Every subarray must have a **key** that matches the initial index.
- This ensures that when multiple arrays appear consecutively, each is correctly identified and associated with its parent object.
- The naming of subarrays prevents ambiguity and ensures data integrity.

### 4. Values Treated as Strings
- All values in SHLS are treated as **strings by default**.
- If values require reinterpretation into other data types (e.g., integers, booleans, or dates), this must be handled by an interpreter.
- This simplification reduces parsing complexity and ensures consistency.

### 5. Minimal Use of Blank Lines
- A single blank line must follow the key index to separate definitions from data blocks.
- Additional blank lines are unnecessary as SHLS uses indentation alone to define hierarchy.
- Blocks of data can be separated by reusing the object index for clarity and readability.

## Example: SHLS Data Structure

Below is an example of a three-level hierarchical SHLS structure. The AI should interpret all values as strings by default and rely on an interpreter for type conversion if needed:

```plaintext
Company
 ID
 Name
 Founded
 Location
 Departments
  DepartmentID
  DepartmentName
  Employees
   EmployeeID
   Name
   Role
   Salary
   StartDate

 2022

 3700000
 1500000

```

In this example:
- Each top-level entry (e.g., `Company`, `Financials`) represents a primary entity.
- Subarrays such as `Departments` and `Employees` are clearly defined with keys, allowing multiple arrays to coexist without ambiguity.
- All data is stored as strings, so values like `"2023-09-15"` or `"true"` are interpreted by default as strings and require an interpreter to convert them to dates or booleans.

---

## Explanation of Example

In the provided example:
- Each **top-level entry** (e.g., `Company`, `Financials`) represents a primary entity.
- Subarrays such as `Departments` and `Employees` are clearly defined with keys, allowing multiple arrays to coexist without ambiguity.
- All data is stored as **strings**, meaning values like `"2023-09-15"` or `"true"` are interpreted as strings by default. These require an interpreter to convert them into appropriate data types like dates or booleans.

---

## Expected Behavior

### 1. Parsing
- The AI should recognize and separate the **index** from data entries.
- Hierarchy should be interpreted **solely based on indentation**, without relying on additional symbols such as brackets or colons.
- Each **subarray** must have a defining key that matches the initial index to ensure clear and unambiguous parsing.

### 2. Generation
- The AI should create **SHLS-compliant structures** that adhere to the defined rules, accurately representing hierarchical data in a compact and readable format.
- Generated data must:
  - Follow the **index-key structure**.
  - Apply a **single blank line** after the index to separate definitions from data.
  - Avoid unnecessary blank lines or structural deviations.

### 3. Error Handling
- The AI should detect and correct **formatting errors**, such as:
  - Missing subarray keys.
  - Inconsistent indentation.
  - Missing or incomplete initial index definitions.
- It should flag **incorrect data types** within values if a reinterpretation function is required, ensuring type integrity during data parsing or generation.

---

## Summary

By adhering to these guidelines, the AI will gain a thorough understanding of SHLS formatting and behavior. This will enable it to:
- Parse SHLS-compliant data structures accurately.
- Generate efficient and properly formatted SHLS data.
- Validate and correct any inconsistencies in SHLS formatting to ensure compliance with the outlined rules.
